## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/orbitr.git
cd orbitr

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up Python backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

```

## Style Guide

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`
- Use meaningful variable names

```typescript
// Good
const calculateStepTiming = (bpm: number, swing: number) => {
  // Implementation
};

// Bad
const calc = (b, s) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

```
feat: Add euclidean rhythm generator

- Implements Bjorklund's algorithm for pattern generation
- Adds UI controls for steps and pulses
- Integrates with existing sequencer architecture

Closes #123
```

### Component Structure

```typescript
// components/ComponentName.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ComponentNameProps {
  // Props interface
}

export const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentNameProps> = ({
  // Destructured props
}) => {
  // Hooks first
  // Handler functions
  // Render
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Documentation
