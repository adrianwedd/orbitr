- **Input validation and sanitization** preventing XSS/injection attacks
- **Resource management testing** for concurrent operations and memory limits
- **Security headers validation** ensuring proper browser protection
- **Error handling verification** preventing information disclosure

### 2. Frontend Performance Testing
- **Memory leak detection** (`__tests__/performance/memory-leak.test.ts`)
  - AudioStore memory management validation
  - Component lifecycle cleanup verification
  - File upload memory efficiency testing
  - Audio scheduling resource cleanup
- **Audio performance benchmarks** (`__tests__/performance/audio-performance.test.ts`)
  - Real-time performance metrics under 10ms audio scheduling
  - UI responsiveness during heavy operations
  - Frame rate consistency during playback
- **Load testing** (`__tests__/performance/load-testing.test.ts`)
  - High volume operations (150+ samples, 1000+ rapid changes)
  - Extended session simulation (1-hour compressed testing)
  - Memory pressure testing and leak detection

### 3. Integration Testing Suite
- **File upload integration** (`__tests__/integration/file-upload.test.ts`)
  - Valid upload scenarios (WAV, MP3, multiple files)
  - Comprehensive error handling (corrupted files, size limits, format validation)
  - Edge case testing (empty files, special characters, drag-and-drop)
- **End-to-end workflows** (`__tests__/integration/end-to-end.test.ts`)
  - Complete AI generation pipeline testing
  - Multi-track audio integration validation
  - Sample library management workflows
  - State persistence and consistency verification

### 4. CI/CD Test Automation
- **GitHub Actions pipeline** (`.github/workflows/comprehensive-testing.yml`)
  - Matrix testing across multiple test suites
  - Automated security scanning and vulnerability detection
  - Performance benchmark monitoring
  - Deployment readiness validation
  - Coverage reporting and quality gates
