# üöÄ Orbitr Development Roadmap

## Project Vision
Transform Orbitr from a functional prototype into a polished, production-ready AI-powered circular sequencer that becomes the go-to tool for creative producers wanting to blend traditional sequencing with AI-generated samples.

## Development Phases

### üìç Phase 1: Foundation Polish (Current - Week 1-2)

- [ ] Implement drag-to-reorder in sample library
- [ ] Add visual waveform preview on step hover
- [ ] Create smooth transitions for all state changes
- [ ] Add tooltips for all controls
- [ ] Implement proper focus management for accessibility

#### Audio Engine
- [ ] Add click track/metronome option
- [ ] Implement proper gain staging to prevent clipping
- [ ] Add limiter on master output
- [ ] Fix any browser-specific audio issues
- [ ] Add audio buffer memory management

- [ ] Pattern chaining/song mode
- [ ] Pattern copy/paste/clear
- [ ] Undo/redo system (Cmd+Z/Cmd+Shift+Z)
- [ ] Pattern variations (fill patterns)

#### Advanced Sequencing
- [ ] Euclidean rhythm generator
- [ ] Polyrhythm support (different step lengths per track)
- [ ] Micro-timing adjustments per step
- [ ] Velocity curves and humanization
- [ ] Ratcheting/flam options

#### Sample Management
- [ ] Sample trimming/editing in-browser
- [ ] Reverse sample playback per step
- [ ] Pitch adjustment per step (-12 to +12 semitones)
- [ ] Sample choke groups
- [ ] Sample favorites/starring system

---

### ü§ñ Phase 3: AI Enhancement (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Maximize the AI generation capabilities

#### Generation Improvements
- [ ] Prompt templates/presets by genre
- [ ] Variation generation (create similar samples)
- [ ] Contextual generation (analyze pattern, suggest samples)
- [ ] Stem separation for uploaded samples
- [ ] Background generation queue with notifications

#### AI Features
- [ ] Auto-generate variations of existing patterns
- [ ] Smart fill (AI completes partial patterns)
- [ ] Genre transformation (convert pattern style)
- [ ] Prompt builder UI with tags/categories
- [ ] Generation history with regenerate option

#### Caching & Performance
- [ ] IndexedDB for client-side sample cache
- [ ] Compression for sample storage
- [ ] Lazy loading for large libraries
- [ ] WebWorker for audio processing
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates

---

### üíé Phase 4: Professional Features (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Add features for serious production use

#### Export & Integration
- [ ] Export to WAV/MP3 (full pattern or loop)
- [ ] Export to Ableton Live Set format
- [ ] MIDI export with velocity/timing
- [ ] Individual stem export
- [ ] Project file format (.orbitr)

#### Collaboration
- [ ] Share patterns via URL
- [ ] Public pattern library
- [ ] User accounts (optional)
- [ ] Pattern ratings/comments
- [ ] Collaborative sessions (WebRTC)

#### Audio Effects
- [ ] Per-step effects (filter, distortion, delay)
- [ ] Send effects (reverb, delay buses)
- [ ] Effect automation lanes
- [ ] Sidechain compression
- [ ] Master bus processing

---

### üö¢ Phase 5: Launch Preparation (Week 9-10)
**Goal**: Production readiness and deployment

#### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Service worker for offline support
- [ ] WebAssembly for critical audio paths
- [ ] CDN setup for static assets
- [ ] Database optimization for pattern storage

#### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite (Jest + React Testing Library)
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization

#### Documentation & Marketing
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Interactive onboarding tour
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Pattern sharing community guidelines
- [ ] Landing page with demos
