{"body": "The 'schedulerTimer' interval in 'OrbitrSequencer.tsx' isn't always cleaned up properly, which can lead to a memory leak. Ensure that the interval is always cleared when the component unmounts or when the sequencer is stopped.\n\n---\n\n**Critique from recent code review:**\n\n- The `schedulerTimerRef` is set using `window.setInterval` but cleared using `clearTimeout`. Change `clearTimeout` to `clearInterval` for semantic correctness."}
