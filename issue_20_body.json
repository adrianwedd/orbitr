{"body": "The 'setTick' call in the 'requestAnimationFrame' loop in 'OrbitrSequencer.tsx' causes a re-render on every frame, which is inefficient. Refactor the animation logic to avoid this unnecessary re-rendering.\n\n---\n\n**Critique from recent code review:**\n\n- The `currentStep` state is managed both by `audioEngine.currentStepRef.current` and `currentStep` as a `useState` variable. This creates a dual source of truth and should be refactored to a single source.\n- The `scheduleNote` function uses both `source.onended` and a `setTimeout` for cleanup. Investigate if the `setTimeout` is redundant and if `source.onended` is sufficient for reliable cleanup."}
